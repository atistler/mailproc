Hey Arnie.

I've attached the error log containing the most recent errors to this ticket.  Feel free to take a look at your convenience.  As stated in our phone conversation, the last error that I see on the load balancer occurred around 9:20 PM on August 16th.  vip02 suffered a 4 second failure and came back up promptly and has since been error-free.

I will bring this up with a senior engineer and determine if there's anything we can do to tweak the settings of the load balancer in order to provide a better environment.

I will get back to you as soon as we determine what can be done.

Regards,
Logicworks NRT
