Bug Fix Advisory - RHBA-2011:1179-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
glibc bug fix update

Updated glibc packages that resolve several issues are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.


Description:
The glibc packages contain the standard C and the standard math libraries. These
libraries are used by multiple programs on the system, and without these
libraries, the Linux system cannot function properly.

These updated glibc packages provide fixes for the following bugs:

* Under certain circumstances, a threaded process could have been granted
incomplete group membership of the user which was running the process. This was
caused by glibc using its default method for group membership determination,
which led to a situation in which multiple threads interfered with each other
while attempting to retrieve information simultaneously. Due to the nature of
the group membership determination method used, each thread ended up with a
different subset of the entire result set. With this update, the group
membership determination method has been modified to precede this interference.
(BZ#712125)

* When a process corrupted its heap, the malloc() function could have entered a
deadlock situation while building up an error message string. This caused the
process unresponsive. With this update, the code has been modified to use the
mmap() function to allocate memory for the error message. This workaround
ensures that the malloc() deadlock no longer occurs when allocating memory for
an error message when the corrupted process heap is detected, and such a process
is now normally aborted. (BZ#712407)

* Prior to this update, the Name Service Caching Daemon (nscd) did not clear the
host cache effectively when repopulating its values. The code has been modified
to schedule nscd cache pruning more accurately. (BZ#712411)

* Previously, nscd did not take into consideration time-to-live (TTL) parameters
for the DNS records it was caching. With this update, the code has been modified
so that nscd now respects TTL parameters when it answers requests for DNS
records. (BZ#715387)

All users of glibc are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
resolve these issues.

Taking Action
-------------
You may address the issues outlined in this advisory in two ways:

     - select your server name by clicking on its name from the list
       available at the following location, and then schedule an
       errata update for it:
           https://rhn.redhat.com/rhn/systems/SystemList.do

     - run the Update Agent on each affected server.


---------------------------------
Changing Notification Preferences
---------------------------------
To enable/disable your Errata Alert preferences globally please log in to RHN
and navigate from "Your RHN" / "Your Account" to the "Preferences" tab.

        URL: https://rhn.redhat.com/rhn/account/UserPreferences.do

You can also enable/disable notification on a per system basis by selecting an
individual system from the "Systems List". From the individual system view
click the "Details" tab.


---------------------
Affected Systems List
---------------------
This Errata Advisory may apply to the systems listed below. If you know that
this errata does not apply to a system listed, it might be possible that the
package profile for that server is out of date. In that case you should refresh 
the system's package profile by running *one* of the following commands as root 
on that system:

 * 'up2date -p' (on Enterprise Linux systems prior to RHEL5)
 * 'rhn-profile-sync' (on Enterprise Linux 5 or later) 

There are 3 affected systems registered in 'Your RHN' (only systems for
which you have explicitly enabled Errata Alerts are shown).
