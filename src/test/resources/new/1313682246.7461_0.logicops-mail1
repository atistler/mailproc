#################################################

Engineer on duty must respond to the client within 15 minutes of receiving the alert, regardless of whether he/she has been able to take any action. This is for ALL LANA alerts, most notably the ?ALL STATUS OK? one.

#################################################

>>>>>>######### LANA PROTOCOL #########>>>>>>>

1. An "incident" is something that lasts longer than 5/10 minutes, eg. a content-scan failure goes off. If it
doesn't come back within 5/10 minutes, we get called.

2. We follow the list. Now, here is some more precision:

Golden Rule:  Call as soon as an "incident" happens. We have our own internal protocol to follow which depends
on this.

**********************************************
 Leave a message on ALL calls you make to Lagardere! 
**********************************************

a) Call the first person on the list. Addition: give them enough time to get to the phone and check their messages (eg.
10 minutes or so).
b) If they don't respond, call the second person on the list. Again, give enough time for them to get to the telephone.
c) If they don't respond, and its been more than, say, 20 minutes, call next person after that. etc.
d) Repeat until someone is on the phone.

******* EOD must email Lana and create a ticket documenting who you spoke to, what they said, when, etc. This if for LW
Documentation!!! ********
