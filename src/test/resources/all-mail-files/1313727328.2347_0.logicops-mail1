Dear Tawfik,

  The maintenance is now complete, I've added 30GB to the root volume and recreated the swap partition (as was necessary in this case).  Can see both correctly set (55GB / and 4GB swap):

[root@afscmeent-smy7v ~]# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1              55G   12G   41G  22% /
tmpfs                 942M     0  942M   0% /dev/shm


[root@afscmeent-smy7v ~]# free -m
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          1883       1812         71          0         38       1028
-/+ buffers/cache:        744       1138
Swap:         4102          0       4102

The server is back up and you can start working on it again.  Let us know if you have any questions.
