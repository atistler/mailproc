Hi Rob,

I think there was a slight misunderstanding.  When I referenced AD I was referring to your active directory domain WEALTHMSI.  Please let me know which servers you are referring to that are not part of the WEALTHMSI domain and I will investigate.   Thank you much.

Regards,

I was actually going to ask you about the AD.  Why are these servers different than our other servers?  Perhaps this is why we struggle with the new servers.  When we log in using RDP the domain appears as AD instead of WEALTHMSI.

Can you let me know the purpose of this change?  And why we wouldn't keep it the same as our current setup?

Hi Rob,

When you access the site from your servers, you are using the AD dns since the servers belong to the domain.  In order to make this work over vpn, I believe we need add your AD name servers as dns servers for the vpn connection.  I'll will look into which settings need to be modified and let you know once the changes have been made.

Rob, 

Are you using a local nameserver to resolve that domain in house? I don't see it setup in the wealthmsi.com zone we have here.

Support,

We have a site, sharepoint.wealthmsi.com that resolves to 10.4.15.59.  This works from within the network but does not resolve through VPN.  How does this get fixed?  Please explain solution because we are beginning to use VPN more and more and the need to map drives and perform other functions will become necessary in the very near future.

Thanks,

Rob
