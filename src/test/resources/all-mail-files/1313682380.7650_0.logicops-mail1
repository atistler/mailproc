Greetings,

 

We receiving alerts every hour saying mysql service was shut down. We checked and mysql has been up for 15 days. I had Rolando look into it and we found nothing. Can you confirm you aren't running puppetd  outside of the DB's, that may be causing this issue. Please see the error below:

 

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' init function returned error.

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' registration as a STORAGE ENGINE failed.

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Unknown/unsupported table type: innodb

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Aborting

110817 21:45:53 [Note] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Shutdown complete
