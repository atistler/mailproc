Karl,

Time Warner has informed us that they have been monitoring the circuit since 1PM today with no errors detected.  They also checked with Verizon and not seeing any errors for past 7 days.  Please try reboot the router again.  Also check with your users and see if there's any heavy usage over the past few days/weeks. 

Regards,

Logicworks NOC
