Hi John,

The issue appears to be some missing config on your ASA.

By default, the ASA will nat the outbound traffic on an inside interface. I believe you need a deny-nat access-list applied to the dmz interface (nat 0), in order
to allow the traffic to pass through.

Hi Dalton.

I was away on vacation for a while, and lost track of where we were with this project.

Is it working?

cheers,
john.

Dalton,

Hi, can you give me a status update on this?  Ideally we'd like to have this done by Wednesday afternoon if possible.  Can you give me a rough ETA as to when you expect the setup to be completed?

Thanks,
Chris
