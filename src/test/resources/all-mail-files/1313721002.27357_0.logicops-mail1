Subject: REPLICATION- Slave is 1373 seconds behind Master 
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
X-Auto-Response-Suppress: DR, RN, NRN, OOF, AutoReply


To check slave status by hand to see if this is improving, log into dborange
and run:

/var/lib/mysql/bin/slavestatus.sh

This will show the current seconds behind master.  If this returns something
other than a positive integer, something more serious is wrong.
