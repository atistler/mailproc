Dear Support,

A) We are receiving multiple emails from your automated system.

The check refers to the below url:
http://10.96.6.219/wbrs/inject2?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
Please note that the correct url is:
http://10.96.6.219:8280/wbrs/inject2?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small

As already communicated for 10.96.6.201-234 the url checks should follow the below pattern:
a.      http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8280/wbrs/inject?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
b.      http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8280/wbrs/inject2?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
c.      http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8280/mir/getMatch?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small&md=xml&retas=id&rec=true
d.      http://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS:8280/wbrs/sdk?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small

B) Also kindly inform us on severity Levels of these alerts. There is only MINOR, MAJOR? And are the escalation levels?

C) Concerning the below urls:

â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/wbrs/inject?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/wbrs/inject2?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/mir/getMatch?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small&md=xml&retas=id&rec=true
â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/wbrs/sdk?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small

They should be checked externally of any timeouts or delays (130ms latency).

Contacts us if any other clarification is needed.

Greetings.

In order to make sure that web content errors are received in a timely fashion by Velti, we've implemented a system that will automatically create and send emails to Logicworks@velti.com

The notifications will look something like the following:

Severity: MINOR
First Occurred: 2011-08-18 10:16:23 EDT
Last Occurred: 2011-08-18 10:16:23 EDT
Occurrences: 1
Source: Internal
Organization: Velti
Device: *NameofDevice*

Message: Web Content Monitoring: Total Transaction Time above threshold: elapsed: 370.776 ms, Threshold 130 ms for url http://10.96.6.231/wbrs/sdk?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small

Sent by Automation Action: Velti - Threshold Limit Reached

View this event at: https://monitoring.logicworks.net/em7/index.em7?exec=events&q_type=aid&q_arg=219860&q_sev=1&q_sort=0&q_oper=0

Currently, you will be receiving these notifications for any threshold breach above 130 ms and any connection refused errors that lasts for more than 30 seconds.  These emails are set to go out every 20 minutes until the problem is acknowledged or resolved and are linked to all the devices specified in your earlier emails.

Also, we've been having some trouble establishing the web content error checks for the adinfuse URL's specified in an email by Mr. Liakos:

â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/wbrs/inject?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/wbrs/inject2?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small
â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/mir/getMatch?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small&md=xml&retas=id&rec=true
â€¢     http://go.adinfuse.com/wbrs/sdk?cid=trt&pid=tcp&fid=small

Could you please clarify the port's that need to be used, the servers to which these checks should be placed on, and the health checks we should be looking for?

Thank you

Regards,
Logicworks NRT
