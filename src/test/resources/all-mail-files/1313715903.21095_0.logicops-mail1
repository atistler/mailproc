Subject: REPLICATION- Slave is 143 seconds behind Master 
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain
X-Auto-Response-Suppress: DR, RN, NRN, OOF, AutoReply


To check slave status by hand to see if this is improving, log into server
and run 

/var/lib/mysql/bin/slavestatus.sh  

This will show the current seconds behind master.  If this returns NULL, there
will be alerts from a second monitoring script with instructions on steps to
resolve.
