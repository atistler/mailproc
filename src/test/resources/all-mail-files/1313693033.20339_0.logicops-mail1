Business Hours

If you don't reach Pete via phone, please begin service restart process (below)

Off-hours
On failure: 
Contact: 
Kossoy, Steven
skossoy@selectleaders.com
646.495.3161 w/ notification 

Restart services as follows:
1.) Login as root
2.) service httpd stop
3.) service tomcat stop
4.) service tomcat start
5.) service httpd start
 

 
NOTE: the start and stop commands for tomcat do not always work quickly.
If the scan fails, we need the operator to try to stop tomcat and check if the process is still running with the command: ps aux|grep java.
The operator may have to forcibly kill the java process (kill -9) and then restart.
