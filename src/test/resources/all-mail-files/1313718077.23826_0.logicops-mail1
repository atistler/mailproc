Hi Jason,

Per one of your previous emails, nodalDR-rto01v does not require a public IP,  but does require connectivity to the outside.  I will put this server in your DMZ network 10.81.8.0, which will accomplish what is needed.  We will however either need to make firewall rules or add static routes so that your servers in 10.80.8.0 can communicate with this server.  Please let us know if there are specific servers in 10.80.8.0 which will communicate with this server, or whether connectivity to the whole 10.80.8.0 is required.  Thank you.

Regards,

Logicworks NOC
