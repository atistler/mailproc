Notes:
Custom Content scans is looking for strings:

"LogicworksDBUP"  in page http://10.252.132.65/epitomax/DBCheck.jsp

"LogicworksWebUp"  in page http://10.252.132.65/epitomax/WebCheck.html

1. Email Mike (mkreamer@psytechsolutions.net), Jennifer Putman (jputman@psytechsolutions.net), and Tony Kline (akline@psytechsolutions.ent)

2. IF you don't hear from Anyone within 30 minutes and you continue to receive failures. Then restart Jaguar.*

3. IF health check is still failing after step 2, restart apache as well.

----------------------------------------------------------
* There is a service on each server called Jaguar. That is our application server and web server too. If we can't be reached, the next thing would be to restart the Jaguar service. After the restart, it will take about 15 seconds before you'll get a response. If that doesn't work, the next thing would be to restart the server.
