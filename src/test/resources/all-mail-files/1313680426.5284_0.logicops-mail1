Notes:
Please update alerts to reflect this procedure for DB failovers:

1. FMC will need to be informed as soon as possible as to the issue. There is no need to call if a simple failover to the clustered server is required.
2. If failover to the replication server is required, FMC needs to be informed as to the last snapshot of the database and when the outage occurred. Failover to the replication server can only take place if approved by Wayne Barron
