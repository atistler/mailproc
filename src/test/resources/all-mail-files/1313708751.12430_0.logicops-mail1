John,
For these servers we don't really need a public IP. They need to be able to
get out to the internet but they will never need direct inbound traffic. Le=
t
me know if we can arrange that. We should probably look at what our options
are for DR either way, do you have sequential IP's available to expand the
netblock? If not we can add another subnet.
Thanks,
Jason
