Kareem,

The user, radar does not have permission to add a new traffic ip group on the load balancer.  This has to be done by us.  If you need a new vip, please let us know, we will allocate this for you. 

Regards,

Logicworks NOC

    Hello:
    
    	I'm trying to get a VIP up and running, and I keep receiving 500 errors.
    
    Is this something that you have seen before?
    
    Thanks,
    Kareem Hamdy
