Tawfik,

The server, smy7v has 13GB of space available.   Do you still want to add 30GB?  Adding disk space to root requires server reboots since the file system needs to be resize.  Please let us know how you want to proceed. 

[root@afscmeent-smy7v ~]# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1              26G   12G   13G  47% /
tmpfs                 942M     0  942M   0% /dev/shm

Regards,

Logicworks NOC
