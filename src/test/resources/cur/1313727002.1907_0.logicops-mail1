As Slave status is showing Null

Check the error at which it is Stuck


1.

To check the error please run

/var/lib/mysql/bin/SlaveError.sh

If the output shows something like:

"Could not insert" , "Could not Delete" ,"Could not Update" , "Duplicate Entry"

proceed to step 2
...
Any other message indicates a serious issue-  contact Senior NOC.


2.

Copy the error into a text file (notepad, etc.)  and then run:

/var/lib/mysql/bin/FixSlave.sh

When this completes, run:

/var/lib/mysql/bin/slavestatus.sh

If it shows a number then it is resolved.

You will receive few more "replication behind in seconds" alerts until slave catches up with primary

Just send an email to the client detailing what happened.

Please dont forget to add "Error", which you saved at step 2, to the body of email

text of the mail should be like:

        Hi,

        The Replication was Stuck due to:

        <paste the error>

        We have Used used SET GLOBAL SQL_SLAVE_SKIP_COUNTER =1 .
        Please check and correct the values corresponding to failed statement in Replicated Database.

        Thanks
        <your name>
