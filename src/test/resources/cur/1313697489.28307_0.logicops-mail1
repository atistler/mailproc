Hello Alex,

Everything looks good on this server now.  I am able to access it via RDP and ping.

You had indicated that "during failovers, corruption in the routing table may occur".  I would like to understand the cause of this issue.  We received the first alert yesterday at 12:32 pm.  I was not aware of any failovers taking place at that time.

Thanks,
Elmer Krauland
