We have seen a corresponding drop in our slow queries for the queries
attached to sitemap and news_sitemap, so that looks good.

We have not seen the same drop from the other queries that hit from the cgi
urls. It seems like the same type of situation, where the urls are getting
polled.

From the first note on the SR, this is what we're trying to do:

'''
We would also like to explore adding another group of URLS to a 5 minute
cache:

http://www.annarbor.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=@[wildcard]&amp;Incl
udeBlogs=1&amp;Template=rss

The brackets are to mark the wildcard and are not part of the url, we've
just need to match anything that hits with a text based "Tag" in there.

Another example: 
http://www.annarbor.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-search.cgi?search=@mlive-a2&amp;Includ
eBlogs=1&amp;Template=rss
'''
When we had previously set up the rule, I know that it was targeted at a
different type of page that comes from the same mt-search.cgi.

As far as the upgrade goes, the next two weeks are chock full of deploys, so
we'd like to do that during the first full week of September. I have
submitted a separate ticket for that.

thanks
