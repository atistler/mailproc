Sam,

You pointed out some 404s in the logs and Nelson also saw what looks to be a
lot of bad calls by ad servers (FlashTalking, Pictela, etc) looking for
"gating" files on our side.

There was an outstanding ticket for us to add some of these files from the
Ad team but we were waiting on hearing some more information back from them.
In the meantime I went ahead and pushed these files
(http://www.bravotv.com/flashtalking/flashtalking_i_frame.html being one of
them), hopefully we'll now see the 404s subside along with our server load.

Matt
