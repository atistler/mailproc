Greetings,

The disk utilization for /db_data on veltimob-db1 is currently at 95%. Disk utilization over 85% impairs our ability to monitor your server correctly and may result loss of data if the disk fills up or downtime. We strongly urge you to take action now to prevent any service issues.

In many cases, clients are able to restore disk space by clearing logs, deleting files no longer in use to another server or by migrating archived files to another server. If you believe that the disks currently in your server are no longer large enough to store your data set please contact your Account Manager to discuss upgrade possibilities. If the disk usage is due to a temporary project, Logicworks offers multiple cloud solutions for short-term projects. Your Account Manager can provide more information on our public and private cloud options.

We appreciate your urgent attention to this disk utilization alarm. If you have any questions about the alert, please contact our NOC at support@logicworks.net or (212)-625-5444 (option 1).

Logicworks NOC
