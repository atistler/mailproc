Only thing to consider is that the restart needs to be done in an orderly fashion

If the DB VIP is on annarbor-db1, here are the steps:

1.	STOP SLAVE on annarbor-db1
2.	STOP SLAVE on annarbor-db2
3.	Restart MySQL on annarbor-db1
4.	START SLAVE on annarbor-db1
5.	START SLAVE on annarbor-db2

These steps are meant to preserve binary log positions so that  circulation replication does not lose its place. When you restart mysql, the shutdown process includes running STOP SLAVE on annarbor-db1. In light of this, steps 1 seems redundant.

However, by running STOP SLAVE manually on annarbor-db1, you guarantee that binary log positions are deactivated in case mysql does not shutdown cleanly. You also force binary log positions to come to halt in the eyes of annarbor-db2. You must also run STOP SLAVE on annarbor-db2 for these same reasons. It will also prevent annarbor-db2 for detecting a timeout and connection retry of its Replication I/O Thread.

BTW START SLAVE on both annarbor-db1 and annarbor-db2 are mandatory since skip-slave-start is enabled in /etc/my.cnf on both machines.
