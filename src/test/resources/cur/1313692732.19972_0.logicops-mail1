This is not really the case because mysqld on both machines have not been down in a while.

annarbor-db1 has not been down in almost 4 days
annarbor-db2 has not been down in almost 16 days

The only way mysql could generate such messages if there were attempts to start mysql while mysql was already up and running. If mysql had crashed, mysqld_safe would have recovered itself, killed mysqld process and started it back up. This has not occurred.

Further example: I ran

ps -ef | grep mysql | grep -v grep

on annarbor-db2 and I got this

[root@db2.annarbor.com ~]# ps -ef | grep mysql | grep -v grep
root      5121     1  0 Aug02 ?        00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --pid-file=/var/lib/mysql/db2.pid
mysql     5375  5121  6 Aug02 ?        1-02:33:43 /usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/ --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --user=mysql --log-error=/var/log/mysqld.log --open-files-limit=32768 --pid-file=/var/lib/mysql/db2.pid --socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

Notice that mysqld_safe and mysqld have identical start dates. If mysqld crashed at the designated timestamp from the error log (110817 21:45:53), the date of mysqld would say Aug17 not Aug02

Greetings,

 

We receiving alerts every hour saying mysql service was shut down. We checked and mysql has been up for 15 days. I had Rolando look into it and we found nothing. Can you confirm you aren't running puppetd  outside of the DB's, that may be causing this issue. Please see the error below:

 

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' init function returned error.

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Plugin 'InnoDB' registration as a STORAGE ENGINE failed.

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Unknown/unsupported table type: innodb

110817 21:45:53 [ERROR] Aborting

110817 21:45:53 [Note] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Shutdown complete


Closing...

    InnoDB: in this failed attempt. InnoDB only wrote those files full of
    InnoDB: zeros, but did not yet use them in any way. But be careful: do not
    InnoDB: remove old data files which contain your precious data!
