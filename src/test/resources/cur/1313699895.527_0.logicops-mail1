Hello,

In order to use the vpn, please go to http://www.logicworks.net/client-files/vpn/index.html (user: logic  password: works) and download the vpn client.  Once you launch the vpn client, please be sure the following entries are entered correctly.

Host: 209.81.95.196
Name: TRACKABOUT-REMOTE-USERS

You should now get a prompt for the user authentication.  Enter your username starafdar and your password.  You can also retrieve the password in this ticket if you don't have it. 

Regards,

Logicworks NOC
